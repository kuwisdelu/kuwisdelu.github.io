<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Show Pride for Democracy: ‘Your liberty is
my liberty’</h1>
<h4 class="date">March 15, 2025</h4>

</div>


<hr />
<p>My fellow Americans and allies of democracy, we are gathered here on
Wampanoag and Massachusetts land on a somber day. Last night, democracy
died in America. Last night, democracy died in the Senate. Today, I’m
sorry to say we no longer live in a republic.</p>
<p>Last year, the Supreme Court and John Roberts handed the tyrant in
the White House a mighty sword. Last night, the Senate voted 62-38 to
place a crown upon the tyrant’s head. So today, we inherit a heavy
legacy. The Courts will not come to save us. Congress will not come to
save us. Today, We the People have inherited the monumental
responsibility of preserving our republic. We have inherited the
momentous duty of breathing new life into the 249-year-old dream of
America. So today, we stand united to raise our voices to say to the
tyrant: America has no kings. Tyrants are not welcome here.</p>
<p>But first we must learn from the lessons that brought us here. We
have learned the hard way that we must be ever vigilant against the
voices calling for moderation. We must be vigilant against the voices
saying “aren’t you overreacting?” We must be vigilant against the voices
saying “it’s not the right time” or “we can’t fight every battle.”</p>
<p>To which I say: why can’t 300 million Americans fight every
battle?</p>
<p>Because we cannot compromise in a fight for our freedoms. We cannot
compromise in the fight for American liberty. We cannot compromise the
very soul of our democracy. And never will we bend to tyrants.</p>
<p>We can never compromise whose freedom of speech we defend, or we
become Columbia University, where young people are taken from their
homes and imprisoned more than a thousand miles away under the threat of
deportation without ever being charged with a crime, and where students
now live in a state of terror, and all remaining auspices of academic
freedom are being surrendered as tribute to the whims of a would-be
king.</p>
<p>We can never compromise when or where transgender people can be our
true selves — whether in bathrooms or in schools or on the fields of
sport — because tyrants who seek to control our bodies in any one place
also seek to control all bodies in all places. Because tyrants who put
chains on transgender womanhood do it because they seek to put chains on
all womanhood.</p>
<p>We can never compromise that the children born on American soil are
themselves American, and that the greatness of America is that it is
willed into being from the collective dream of all of its citizens no
matter where we are born. Because my mother’s Zuni ancestors always
lived in what is now New Mexico since long before America was born, and
my father’s Polish ancestors traveled across the Atlantic from East
Germany to Milwaukee, Wisconsin more than a hundred years ago, and I am
only here today in Boston because — by the providence of the American
dream — they found each other.</p>
<p>We can never compromise that America is the dream of Indigenous
people who have always been here, and it is the dream of immigrants who
came here seeking freedom, and it is the dream of Black people whose
enslaved ancestors had no choice in the matter.</p>
<p>We must never forget that we are all Americans in this together, and
when tyrants come for any of us, they come for all of us, because all of
our fates are interconnected. So we must always say to ourselves: “Your
liberty is my liberty. Your freedom is my freedom. Your struggle is my
struggle.”</p>
<p>Now some of you may remember that 60 years and 6 days ago today, a
brave group of about 600 Black Americans set out from Selma, Alabama to
the state capital of Montgomery to demand the right to vote, and on
climbing the crest of Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were met with the most
fearsome hate and bloody brutality from white segregationists, the likes
of which may soon stain all of America once again if the tyrant in the
White House has his way.</p>
<p>What some of you may not remember is that in the wake of what became
known as Bloody Sunday, clergy and citizens from all across America
journeyed to Selma to join a second march to Montgomery.</p>
<p>Among them, a white minister named James Reeb traveled from Boston,
Massachusetts to join the march in Selma. James Reeb lived in Roxbury,
because, in his words, “you cannot make a difference for African
Americans while living comfortably in a white community.” That second
march from Selma was again turned away at the crest of Edmund Pettus
Bridge, but later that evening, white segregationists cracked James
Reeb’s skull open. James Reeb died 2 days later. James Reeb’s murder led
to the court order that protected a third march of people of all races
who finally made the 54-mile trek from Selma to Montgomery where
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered a speech to over 25,000 Americans
on the steps of the state capital.</p>
<p>But just as Boston blood was spilled in Selma for the American dream,
let us not also forget that precipitating that third march, there were
protests in 80 cities all across America, just as today we are but one
of many protests all across our 50 states.</p>
<p>And we must not forget that even though we are committed to the
course of nonviolence, that does not mean we will not bleed. Even though
we are committed to peace, that does not mean we will not need to put
our bodies in harm’s way or even sacrifice our lives for the freedoms of
our fellow Americans. James Reeb understood that.</p>
<p>Indeed, the regime in Washington, D.C. already has blood on its
hands. Thousands will die for lack of food and medicine from USAID, and
some have already lost their lives for lack of oxygen to breathe, and
babies who could have been healthy are now born with HIV.</p>
<p>But even before those preventable tragedies transpired, early on the
27th of January in Syracuse, New York, a transgender veteran named Elisa
Rae Shupe, the first American to receive a federal nonbinary gender
marker, wrote a final letter to the world before wrapping herself in a
transgender pride flag and breathing her last breath. “Fuck you,
America!” she wrote. “I don’t want your hatred.”</p>
<p>Elisa Rae Shupe was a veteran. She served her country.</p>
<p>Elisa Rae Shupe was denied the American dream. She was denied life.
She was denied liberty. She was denied the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>“But,” she also wrote, “my death is not a surrender.”</p>
<p>“You cannot erase nonbinary and transgender people because you give
birth to more of us each day.”</p>
<p>We will never forget Elisa Rae Shupe. We will fight for her. We will
fight for each other, and we will not leave anyone behind. We will fight
to save our republic, because no one else will save it for us. We will
fight to defend our democracy, because all people are born yearning to
be free, and we are all each others’ siblings.</p>
<p>Because your liberty is my liberty.</p>
<p>Because your freedom is my freedom.</p>
<p>Because your struggle is my struggle.</p>
<p>Because America is not defined by the tyrant in the White House.</p>
<p>Because America is the dream of the People.</p>
<p>Because no lie can live forever, and tyrants are not welcome
here.</p>
<p>Because when we go home tonight, we will all dream of freedom and
liberty for all and our hope will become an unstoppable force and our
love for each other will be unfathomably deep and unbreakable.</p>
<p>Because no matter what the Courts say, and no matter what Congress
says, and no matter what the White House says, We the People will rise
together and join our voices to say what we know to be true:</p>
<p>America has no kings.</p>
