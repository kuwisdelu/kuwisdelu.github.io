<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Saving Our Union: ‘We the People’</h1>
<h4 class="date">March 4, 2025</h4>

</div>


<hr />
<p>My fellow Americans and our welcome allies who have found a home on
American soil: we are gathered here today on the land of the Wampanoag
and Massachusetts Peoples, in one of the great cities where America was
born nearly 250 years ago.</p>
<p>We are gathered here in Boston, because America is a nation in
crisis. On this evening, in Washington, D.C., the president will address
a joint session of Congress. But that address will not address this
crisis — a crisis that threatens the very heart of America. That is why
we are gathered here today: it has fallen to us, the American People,
and our allies in democracy, to rise up and meet this crisis. We are
here, because America is a free nation, because America is a democracy,
and because we free Americans will not let our democracy die in
darkness. We are here, because America has no kings.</p>
<p>And yet we find ourselves with a tyrant in the White House who
fancies himself a king. We find ourselves with a president who has
chosen not to faithfully execute the laws of our country, but has
instead chosen to violate our Constitution again and again with his
every executive action. We find ourselves with a president who has
turned his back on our closest allies, and instead has aligned himself
with the dictators of the world. We find ourselves with a president who
has chosen not to keep the promises of America, but instead to sell
America to the highest bidders. And even now, one of those billionaire
bidders has embedded himself and his cronies in every agency of our
federal government like a computer virus, poised to delete our civil
services and dismantle our most vital institutions of health, science,
education, and public safety.</p>
<p>But while what is happening in the White House is the most treasonous
betrayal, there are men and women in our Courts and our Congress who
have failed the American People as well. By enabling the tyrant in the
White House and giving him license to believe he is above the law and,
therefore, to crown himself king. By failing this test of leadership and
failing to hold him accountable to Congress. By ignoring the Will of the
People when we have raised our voices in town halls and state capitals
across the country again and again to express in no uncertain terms,
louder and louder, until it resounds in a single, unwavering voice:
America has no kings.</p>
<p>It is no mistake that we are gathered here in Boston, in one of the
places where the promissory note that became the American dream was
first imagined, and where 251 years ago, the Sons of Liberty dressed as
Mohawks, boarded ships, and threw crates of British tea into Boston
Harbor. These brave revolutionaries dressed in redface not only to
disguise their identities, but also to show that they were not British
but Americans, and to symbolically sever their bonds as subjects to a
tyrant king. And while our Constitution drew inspiration from the
democracy of the Iroquois Confederacy, I also remember that within
walking distance from here, the Old North Church stood not only as a
beacon for freedom, but also as an institution of segregation where
enslaved Black and Indigenous People worshipped separately from their
masters.</p>
<p>And yet, as an Indigenous American, I have never felt more Hope than
I do now.</p>
<p>Because I have my ancestors’ memory of America and the many Americas
that came before now, stretching back before America was born, before
America was a dream, and I know this land is Native land, and Native
land is for the People. Because I know that 2,500 miles away from here
in what is now New Mexico, my Pueblo ancestors rebelled and cast out our
Spanish rulers rather than suffer their oppression. Because even though
the threat to our American democracy is dire and profound, I believe in
my blood that We the People can come together with a profound unity the
likes of which has never before been seen in our country’s history.</p>
<p>Because America is not only a dream but a promise. Because all of our
American sisters and brothers and siblings now know what Black and
Indigenous Americans have always known: that it is up to us to hold
America to its promise; that the dream flickers and dies when we grow
too complacent in our sacred duty of keeping all of the lanterns of
Liberty lit; that it is up to us to Save our Union when it is in dire
distress.</p>
<p>Because four score and seven years after our founders brought forth,
on this continent, a nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal, some brave Americans fought
a war over that promise, and a great American signed a momentous decree
called the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>Because the last time Americans united to stand against the forces of
fascism, the brave Black and Indigenous Americans who went to war for
America in Europe and the Pacific came home and found they still could
not fairly cast their vote in a ballot box, but today we freely elect
Black and Indigenous Americans to our public offices.</p>
<p>Because I grew up never knowing I had any choice but to be a boy, but
I speak to you today not only as an Indigenous American but as a queer
and transgender woman.</p>
<p>My fellow transgender Americans know all too well that the threat we
face is an existential one. My fellow Indigenous Americans know all too
well the signs of genocide. We know all too well that killing the
transgender child to save the cisgender sensibility is no different than
killing the Indian to save the man. We know the threat we face.</p>
<p>Because for 249 years, We the People have labored to bend the arc of
the American dream toward justice and Liberty for all, but our White
House is now occupied by liars, tyrants, and a would-be king who all
wish to undo our centuries of progress, dismantle our civil rights,
destroy the lives and Liberty of the People, and replace our democracy
with a billionaires’ oligarchy.</p>
<p>And so I am here today to ask my fellow Americans to raise their
voices and stand together against the forces of fascism and autocracy
before it is too late.</p>
<p>I believe We the People can come together to Save our Union. I
believe We the People can raise our voices in unison and say we hold
these truths to be self-evident: that all People are created equal; that
our government is instituted by the People to secure the rights of the
People to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness; that government
of the People, by the People, and for the People is the promise of
America; that America has no kings.</p>
<p>I believe We the People can come together to Save our Union before it
is too late.</p>
<p>I believe We the People can come together and forge new bonds of
community and kinship more unbreakable than ever before in our nation’s
history.</p>
<p>I believe We the People will turn to our immigrant neighbors and our
Black and Brown and Indigenous neighbors, and our disabled neighbors,
and our queer and transgender neighbors and say with profound love and
cosmic responsibility: you are safe with me, and I will fight for
you.</p>
<p>This is my great Hope, and tonight, you become messengers of Hope. We
must not only raise our voices to our elected officials in Washington
and in our state capitals and in our city halls; we must also speak to
our friends and our loved ones and our neighbors. When we go home, we
must get on the phone and talk not only with our senators and our
representatives but also with our aunts and uncles and parents and
siblings and peers.</p>
<p>Because We the People must hold America to its promises.</p>
<p>We the People must ensure America honors its treaties.</p>
<p>We the People must bend the arc of the American dream once again
toward justice.</p>
<p>We the People will make our voices heard, and we will say in unison:
America has no kings; democracy can never die so long as We the People
fight for it; and we will never stop fighting until the American dream
is birthed into reality. We will make our voices heard in every village,
every town, and every city of this country; from the rolling hills of
Boston to the windswept mountains of Waitsfield to the howling highways
of Los Angeles; from the towering cities of New York and Chicago, to the
sun-baked soil of Zuni Pueblo. We will make ourselves heard.</p>
<p>Because America is a promise born of the People, by the People, and
for the People, and we shall not let that promise be broken.</p>
