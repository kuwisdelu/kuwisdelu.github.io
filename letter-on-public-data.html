<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Open Letter on Public Data</h1>
<h4 class="date">February 5, 2025</h4>

</div>


<hr />
<p>To the American People:</p>
<hr />
<div id="preamble" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Preamble</em></h4>
<p>As a statistician, I can’t overstate the dangers of the crisis in the
federal government right now.</p>
<p>As a private citizen of the USA, I have my personal concerns as
well.</p>
<p>As a Native American and enrolled member of the Zuni Tribe, I could
write about the attacks on our sovereignty and citizenship through the
illegal actions of ICE.</p>
<p>As a transgender woman, I could write about the attacks on my
humanity through the erosion of our civil rights and attempted erasure
of transgender Americans from public life.</p>
<p>As an autistic person, I could write about the existential threat
that the nomination of RFK Jr. to the Department of Health and Human
Services poses to disabled and neurodivergent Americans.</p>
<p>As an indigenous person, I could write about the utter heartbreak and
humanitarian atrocity that is the threat of ethnic cleansing of the
Palestinian people from their homeland.</p>
<p>But I am writing this letter as a professional statistician to warn
the American people of the clear and present danger that the Trump
administration poses to our country’s health, security, and
sustainability as a nation.</p>
<p>This perspective is wholly my own and does not represent the official
position of any institution. But I do sincerely hope my colleagues are
prepared to speak up and uphold their ethical responsibilities to their
respective fields.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="perspective" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Perspective</em></h4>
<p>I am a statistician by training. As a professor, I teach data
science. As a researcher, I develop statistical methods with
applications ranging from cancer detection to drug discovery.</p>
<p>As a professional statistician, I have an ethical responsibility to
protect and respect the rights of data subjects and those directly
affected by statistical practices; I have an ethical responsibility to
stakeholders in collection, release, and dissemination of data; I have a
professional duty to report statistical misconduct and violations of the
right of data stakeholders.</p>
<p>Today, those data subjects and stakeholders are the American people.
The institutions to whom I would report this misconduct are the very
institutions perpetrating it.</p>
<p>So I am addressing this letter to my fellow Americans directly.</p>
<p>The Trump administration — through the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) and other arms of the executive branch — is
systematically purging and misappropriating data that belongs to the
American people. These actions recklessly endanger the American
people.</p>
<div id="health" class="section level5">
<h5>Health</h5>
<p>These actions put the health of the American people at risk through
the deletion of vital public health data. Researchers in the USA and
around the world depend on public health data from agencies like the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Much of this data has now been deleted as a direct result of
President Trump’s executive orders.</p>
<p>With the world only five years removed from a devastating global
pandemic in COVID-19, and with imminent warnings of another in H5N1 bird
flu, it is beyond irresponsible and unethical to delete this public
health data, which was collected with taxpayer money for the benefit of
the American people. It will delay timely response to public health
issues. It will cost lives.</p>
<p>As a transgender statistician, I must also note that while these
executive orders are primarily designed to target transgender Americans,
the deleted data and effects are not limited to transgender Americans.
This affects healthcare research and response for everyone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Trump administration’s interference in the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) will
have dire and long-lasting consequences on health. These are the
institutions that make America a world leader in health and biomedical
research and scientific research generally. Private companies rely on
the foundational research funded by these institutions. The discoveries
that power breakthrough health treatments come from publicly-funded
research driven by scientific merit rather than profitability.</p>
<p>The deletion of this data and defunding of these institutions will
make America less healthy, possibly for decades for come. Many of us
will lose our lives or the lives of loved ones to deaths that could have
been treated or prevented.</p>
</div>
<div id="security" class="section level5">
<h5>Security</h5>
<p>These actions put the security of the American people at risk through
the unauthorized and illegal access of the private data of US citizens.
The Treasury Department has reported that officials from DOGE have
access to sensitive Treasury Department financial systems that process
trillions of dollars to Americans in the form of tax refunds, social
security payments, Medicare and Medicaid payments, and more. Elon Musk
and DOGE officials do not have proper security clearance or
authorization to access this private data, and they are operating
without any transparency or oversight.</p>
<p>This is a cybersecurity risk that is unparalleled and unprecedented
in the history of the USA.</p>
<p>This is the private data of private American citizens like you and
me. It is now being accessed by an unelected billionaire and untested
interns without the cybersecurity expertise and experience to safeguard
this sensitive data against threats both foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Trump administration’s interference in the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) will
have consequences for American security too.</p>
<p>Early in his term, President Trump correctly identified innovation in
AI as vital to American economic and national security. However, the
actions of the Trump administration are in direct opposition to
innovation in AI research. While the most well-publicized AI models like
ChatGPT and Gemini come from the private sector, the foundational
research behind these models happens at research universities.
Researchers at OpenAI and Google build on the doctoral research they did
as university students to develop state-of-the-art AI models for
American companies.</p>
<p>The USA attracts the best researchers in the world through
institutions like the NSF and the NIH. Without these institutions and
their funding, the best researchers in the world will go elsewhere. Even
short term delays in funding can have a long-term chilling effect and
can lead to an exodus of intellectual talent from the USA, including AI
researchers.</p>
<p>The American people are less safe today due to the actions of the
Trump administration.</p>
<p>The continued action of Elon Musk and DOGE to access extremely
sensitive data represents an ongoing cybersecurity threat against the
American people.</p>
</div>
<div id="sustainability" class="section level5">
<h5>Sustainability</h5>
<p>These actions put the sustainability of the USA itself at risk.
Regardless of your beliefs about anthropogenic climate change, it is
self-evident that extreme weather events and natural disasters are
becoming increasingly frequent.</p>
<p>In the wake of catastrophic fires in California stemming from
critically dry conditions, the Trump administration and DOGE are now
targeting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
the federal agency responsibly for tracking weather and climate data.
This data drives not only weather forecasts for the general public but
also vital monitoring for extreme weather events and natural
disasters.</p>
<p>Deleting this data poses a risk to our sustainability as a nation and
to the lives of the people in the communities affected by these events.
It will affect the ability to rapidly respond to coming natural
disasters. This, too, will cost lives.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="plea" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Plea</em></h4>
<p>I ask my colleagues and the American people to speak up about the
reckless misconduct by the Trump administration and by Elon Musk and
DOGE.</p>
<p>This is our data. This is the biggest data breach in history. It
represents an ongoing cybersecurity threat. And it endangers every
single US citizen.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter because I am fulfilling my ethical duty as a
statistician by doing so.</p>
<p>I ask the US Congress and the Courts to fulfill theirs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Prof. Kylie Ariel Bemis, PhD</p>
