_Cardinal_ is an R package designed for efficient analysis of mass spectrometry-based imaging experiments. The capabilities include visualization of single and composite ion images, pre-processing (normalization, spectral smoothing, baseline reduction, peak picking, peak filtering, and peak alignment), as well as traditional and novel supervised and unsupervised methods such as image segmentation (clustering/classification), principle components analysis (PCA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA).

_Cardinal_ was awarded the 2015 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award by the American Statistical Association.

_matter_ is an R package designed for rapid prototyping of new statistical methods when working with larger-than-memory datasets on disk. Unlike related packages _bigmemory_ and _ff_, which also work with file-backed larger-than-memory datasets, _matter_ aims to offer strict control over memory and maximum flexibility with file-based data structures, so it can be easily adapted to domain-specific file formats, including user-customized file formats.
