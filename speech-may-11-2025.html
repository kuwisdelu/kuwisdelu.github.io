<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Hands Off Worcester Mothers: ‘Give us due
process’</h1>
<h4 class="date">May 11, 2025</h4>

</div>


<hr />
<p>On Mother’s Day, we are here to petition our government for redress
of the most dire of grievances: the cruel and violent separation of a
mother from her daughters.</p>
<p>Who tore Augusta Clara’s mother from her daughters? Who arrested her
16-year-old sister as their mother was being abducted?</p>
<p>We know the masked agents of ICE stole Augusta Clara’s mother from
her daughters on Eureka Street. We know members of the Worcester police
pushed a teenage girl to the pavement before arresting her, even as her
mother was being driven away from her life and into the most
inaccessible Orwellian nightmare of ICE detention. We know the police
even arrested a Worcester School Committee candidate who was only trying
to protect this family.</p>
<p>But the hands that conspired to create this terror belong to more
powerful people than the cowardly agents of ICE. Those hands belong to
“border czar” Tom Homan and secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem.
Those hands belong to the Republicans in Congress who refuse to take
responsibility for the terror they’ve helped to create. Those hands
belong to any Democrats in Congress who still question whether it’s the
“right time” — politically speaking — to oppose the president’s
so-called immigration policy.</p>
<p>Those guilty hands also belong to every single American citizen who
could speak up in protest without fear of deportation but instead choose
to remain silent and complacent rather than join the movement to resist
tyranny.</p>
<p>But the guiltiest hands belong to the President of the United States
who is powerful enough to wage war on America’s most poor, marginalized,
and vulnerable residents but who is also so powerless that he is unable
to pick up a phone and facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and
hundreds of other immigrants that his administration has unlawfully
trafficked to a foreign concentration camp across the sea in El
Salvador. And the guilty hands also belong to John Roberts and the other
justices of his Court who gave the president a blank check of power in
place of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>So we are here to demand the Constitution. We are here to demand the
due process of the law that is guaranteed to every person on American
soil, citizen or non-citizen, as is our Constitutional right. We are
here to firmly declare that no person or agency is above the law.</p>
<p>Give us due process, and we will be one step closer to reclaiming a
democracy that has been captured by tyrants.</p>
<p>Give us due process, and we will no longer need to protest the
kidnapping of our community members without warrant or reason, because
the agents of ICE will be forced to present a warrant and reason for
their actions.</p>
<p>Give us due process, and we will no longer need to protest the unjust
detention of our community members in concentration camps across seas
and state borders, because they will be given the legal opportunity to
defend themselves and demonstrate that they are neither violent
criminals nor gang members.</p>
<p>Give us due process, and our lawyers will no longer need to search
the country to find where their clients have been trafficked, because
the government will be forced to act in good faith and with respect for
the dignity of the people in their custody.</p>
<p>Give us due process, and all people now living on American soil will
once again be free from the terror of being taken from the streets of
their communities without recourse or redress or justice.</p>
<p>We must call these incidents for what they are. These abductions are
terrorism. ICE is a state-sponsored terrorist organization. What other
purpose has been served here? If the people being taken are “the worst
of the worst,” then where is the government’s evidence? Why does the
government ignore court orders?</p>
<p>Because the purpose is to promote terror, and the purpose of that
terror is to take from us the natural rights and civil liberties
guaranteed to us by the Constitution — not just to American citizens,
but to all people on American soil. Because the purpose of this
administration is to consolidate power in the office of the president at
the expense of our democracy. Because our president believes himself to
be a king rather than a servant of the people.</p>
<p>Our president’s supporters talk about rule of law, but what they
support is not the rule of law, but the rule of man. One man. A true
rule of law means that no one is above the law. Not the police. Not ICE.
Not the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Our president’s supporters call us a mob. But if there was any mob in
Worcester that day, it was a mob of ICE agents and Worcester police.
They are the ones who disturbed the peace. They are the ones who brought
chaos to this city when members of the Worcester community came together
to protect a family from being torn apart.</p>
<p>Now Worcester police must make the same decision that all local law
enforcement must make: who do you serve and protect? Do you serve and
protect the members of your own community? Or do you serve and protect
the agents of ICE? Will you live up to the American ideal that all
people are created equal, and America must provide equal protection
under the law, and that equal protection must mean respecting the right
to due process? Or will you help the agents of ICE in promoting the
terror and tyranny of a would-be king?</p>
<p>Our demand is due process. Our demand is that our own cities and our
state governments refuse to cooperate with a terrorist agency acting
outside the rule of law. If you believe in America, if you believe in
the rule of law, then it is your patriotic duty to refuse to cooperate
with ICE. It is your patriotic duty to refuse to intervene when your
fellow American citizens act to protect their own community if you will
not protect it for them.</p>
<p>Because this terror must end.</p>
<p>Now I know that our blood runs hot with righteous rage because we are
faced with the gravest of injustices, and justice must be done. But in
our enthusiasm for justice, we must not allow ourselves to drink from
the same kool-aid of retribution as the perpetrators of these crimes. We
must not allow ourselves to be baited into violence by the lips of
instigators or the poisonous provocation of this administration. We must
remain committed to nonviolence, because we are the ones dedicated to
the rule of law. Because our demand is due process of the law, and the
end of tyranny in America.</p>
<p>We will protest, and we will resist, and we will not let there be
peace without justice, but we must remain nonviolent along the way;
because we will show the rest of America who the real criminals are. We
will show America that the only mob rule is the rule of ICE. We will
show America that the only violence being perpetrated is the violence of
the war this administration is waging against its own people, against
democracy, and against America itself.</p>
<p>And when America wakes up, this terror will end. When America wakes
up, this tyranny will end. Because America is better than this. America
must be better than this. Because millions of immigrants across history
— including Augusta Clara’s mother — have fled tyranny in their
homelands for the dream of freedom in America, and the people of America
will not let that dream be extinguished by a man who would be king.</p>
<p>Because we stand on Nipmuc land, and as an Indigenous person, I
declare that if there is any legitimacy in America, it is that America
must be the land of the free and America must become once again a land
that welcomes immigrants and all peoples, or America itself is
illegal.</p>
<p>So America must be free. The people of America must be free. We will
fight for due process. We will fight for the Constitution. We will fight
for rule of law. We will fight to re-unite the families separated by
tyranny.</p>
<p>And when we fight, we win. Because the people united will never be
defeated.</p>
