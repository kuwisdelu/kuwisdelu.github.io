## Overview

The course offers students a capstone opportunity to practice data science skills learned in previous courses, and build a portfolio. Students practice visualization, data wrangling, and machine learning skills by applying them to semester-long term projects on real-world data. Students may either propose their own projects or choose from a selection of industry options. Emphasis on the overall data science process, including identification of the scientific problem, selection of appropriate machine learning methods, and visualization and communication of results. There will be occasional lectures on special topics such as visualization, communication, and data science ethics.
