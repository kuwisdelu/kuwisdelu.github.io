<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Stand Up for Science: ‘Rebellions are built
on hope’</h1>
<h4 class="date">March 7, 2025</h4>

</div>


<hr />
<p>My fellow scientists, American citizens, and dear allies of
democracy: it is my honor to stand here with so many of you today. We
are here to raise our voices in a righteous battle to protect American
science and democracy from the violent whims of a billionaire who now
occupies our White House and the madness of a president who has crowned
himself king, who has raised a sword against the very scientific
achievements that have helped define America’s greatness, and who must
now be stopped at all costs.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that so many of us have gathered here in Boston,
the very same shining city on a hill that the Puritans and American
presidents past and present have invoked as a vision of the American
dream.</p>
<p>Three score and three years ago, one of those great Americans, whose
presidential library in this shining city has now been shuttered by the
tyrant in the White House, proposed an impossible task to a generation
who also bore witness to the violent struggle and blessed awakening of
racial justice in this country. That great American called upon a
generation to cast off the chains of earthly gravity and put an American
on the moon within the decade, not because it is easy, but because it is
hard. That dream itself — one of the greatest feats of science and
engineering humankind has ever attempted — was only possible because of
the tireless work of Black women scientists. Scientists like Katherine
Johnson, who at the beginning of that decade could still not reliably
cast her vote in the ballot box, who only 4 years after the passage of
the Voting Rights Act, computed the equations that guided Apollo 11 to
break free of its terrestrial bonds, sent it forth 239,000 miles across
the vastness of space to plant an American flag on lunar soil, and
returned it and our astronauts safely back to this blue planet we call
home.</p>
<p>Now it is up to us to do the hard things, to confront the injustices
of our own time, to take up the struggle of our forefathers and
foremothers, and live up to the tenacity of those who came before
us.</p>
<p>Like those brave, marginalized scientists of the past who
relentlessly pushed this country forward, many of us here know what it
is the be the only one in the room. The only woman. The only person of
color. The only Indigenous person. The only queer person. The only
transgender person. So do I know the feeling of being the only one.</p>
<p>When I received my final diploma from Purdue University, nearly 9
years ago now, I became — to the best of my knowledge — the first Native
American to achieve a doctorate in statistics. Since then, I have been
honored with multiple awards, taught thousands of students, and I have
spoken at the Boston Museum of Science during its celebration of Native
American Heritage Month last year. I have developed software and machine
learning models used by hundreds of other scientists around the world to
decipher the molecular mysteries of cancer, PTSD, and aging. In the days
following the inauguration of the president who would be king, I labored
over a research grant proposal for the National Institutes of Health
while watching the confirmation hearings of the man who would soon
dismantle my work. Nonetheless, I persevered. I submitted that
grant.</p>
<p>But the tyrant now occupying our White House would rather that
scientists like me would not exist. The tyrant now occupying our White
House would rather that people like me would be erased from public life
entirely. The tyrant in the White House would rather wipe all of our
scientific achievements from history than face the possibility that a
transgender woman from Zuni Pueblo could achieve what mediocre white men
did not. These are the injustices of our time. This is the great
struggle we face.</p>
<p>As a country, we stand now on the precipice of an abyss. We have
emerged from the depths of one global pandemic, only to be facing down
the looming threat of another one, while the American scientists who
could protect us are either unemployed or must work with their hands
bound behind their backs and their mouths gagged by the muzzle of an
authoritarian regime. We have eradicated terrible illnesses that once
ravaged our nation and the world, only to see them re-emerge, as the
reins of our healthcare system are handed to a conspiracy theorist who
believes I am autistic only because I am vaccinated. And even as I
address you now, a billionaire oligarch continues to dismantle our
institutions of science, education, and public safety.</p>
<p>And where, we may ask, are our allies? Where are the pharmaceutical
companies that profit from our research? Where are the technological
giants of Silicon Valley who have built their artificial intelligence
empires on the backs of academics like us? Where are the universities
that purport to support us but remain silent even as their faculty and
students are under attack? Where are our colleagues who have buried
their heads in the sands of ignorance and pretend that they are safe
while we are not?</p>
<p>But even as we stare into the abyss, I have hope. Because we are here
together. Because science is one of the undying flames that lights the
lanterns of Liberty. Because where some would see despair, I see
rebirth. For too long, we scientists have feared to enter the political
fray. For too long, our endeavors have been misunderstood by the public.
For too long, we have let the propaganda machine of fascism spreads
disinformation and lies.</p>
<p>No more. No more.</p>
<p>No longer can we stay silent while we witness the coup of a would-be
king. No longer can we stay silent while the tyrant in the White House
tramples on our work. No longer can we stay silent while the ministers
of disinformation dismantle scientific truth. No longer can we stay
silent while the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies
exploit our work and hold American patients hostage to the almighty
dollar. No longer can we stay silent while the technological giants of
Silicon Valley ignore every ethical tenet of artificial intelligence,
intellectual property, and data privacy. No longer can we stay silent
while a billionaire oligarch deletes the data and scientific services
that belong to the American people. No longer can we stay silent, my
friends.</p>
<p>That is why we are gathered here in Boston, one of the brightest
beacons of biomedical research in the world, where I count my
collaborators across myriad hospitals and research institutions across
this great city. We are here because we will not stay silent. We are
here because we will fight. We are here because science will fight.</p>
<p>And if we are to fight, we must bring our allies.</p>
<p>We must pull our colleagues’ heads from the sands of ignorance. We
must hold our academic institutions accountable to our communities. We
must become political and call our senators and our representatives and
our mayors and our governors and our attorneys general and ask them to
fight for us too. We must speak to journalists and tell them our
stories.</p>
<p>We must go out and speak the truth in every corner of our
communities, because truth is the language of Liberty and the very
essence of the scientific endeavor.</p>
<p>But we must not stop there. If we are to come together, we must fight
for those we ask to fight for us. We must stand up for our federal
workers. We must stand up for veterans. We must stand up for immigrants.
We must stand up for our queer and transgender siblings.</p>
<p>And we must stand up for the arts and humanities. For who among us
has not been inspired by the journeys of the crew of the Starship
Enterprise or the impossible struggle of a rebel alliance against an
evil empire, a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away?</p>
<p>In the words of a great freedom fighter: “rebellions are built on
hope.”</p>
<p>In each of you today, I see the light of hope. And together, we can
topple an empire.</p>
<hr />
