## Overview

This course discusses the practical issues and techniques for data importing, tidying, transforming, and modeling. It offers a gentle introduction to techniques for processing data. Programming is a cross-cutting aspect of the course. Students will gain experience with data science tools through short assignments. The course work includes a term project based on real-world data. Required topics include: Data management and processing: definition & background; Data transformation; Data import; Data cleaning; Data modeling; Relational and analytic databases; Basics of SQL; Programming in R; MapReduce fundamentals and distributed data management; Data processing pipelines, connecting multiple data management and analysis components; Interaction between the capabilities and requirements of data analysis methods (data structures, algorithms, memory requirements) and the choice of data storage and management tools; Repeatable and reproducible data analysis.

## Policies

Please let me know if you use a different name or pronouns from what appears the class roster. You may use a preferred name on Piazza and when submitting assignments and exams, but please be consistent and inform the instructors. The Northeastern [LGBTQA Center](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/lgbtqa/) can provide resources for [changing your name and gender marker in the Northeastern system](https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/training-and-education/gender-identity-personal-pronouns-syllabus-guidance/).

Please reach out to me early if you have difficulty keeping up with class material or completing assignments for personal reasons. The [We Care](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/we-care/) program at Northeastern University is a resource available to you in times of stress.

All students are expected to abide by the university's [academic integrity policy](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/) and respect Northeastern's [commitment to diversity and inclusion](https://www.northeastern.edu/academic-plan/strategic-themes/diversity-and-inclusion/).

Northeastern University strictly prohibits discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran, or disability status. [Please review Northeastern's Title IX policy](https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/), which protects individuals from sex or gender-based discrimination, including discrimination based on gender-identity. Faculty members are required to report all allegations of sex/gender-based discrimination to the Title IV coordinator.

*Please be kind and respectful to your fellow students regardless of identity or background. Students are expected to respect and use other students' names and pronouns.*

## Homework

Six individual homework assignments are to be completed for this class. Each homework is due by email before class on the day it is listed, unless the instructions specify otherwise. Late homeworks will not be accepted. Extensions may be given individually if requested at least 48 hours in advance of the due date with a reasonable justification. Requests for re-grades must be made in writing no less than 1 week after receiving a grade. (The new grade may be lower than the original grade.)

Some aspects of the homework may be discussed with each other, but they should be completed indivudually, and your submitted work should be your own. Sharing of worked solutions will not be tolerated and will be considered cheating. Solutions with a very high degree of similarity with another past or current student's will be considered plagiarism, and will be treated accordingly.

***

## Exams

There will be three cumulative exams. All exams will be completed in class on the dates scheduled above.

***

## Project

There will be a final project done in groups of 3 to 5 students. More details will be posted later in the semester.


***

## Grading

The grade in this class is based out of 1000 points, distributed as follows:

- Homework: 6 x 50 pts
- Exams: 3 x 100 pts
- Final Project: 300 pts
	- Proposal: 50 pts
	- Presentation: 100 pts
	- Report: 150 pts
- Peer Review: 100 pts

Final grades will follow the following scale:

- A : 900 - 1000 pts
- B : 800 - 899 pts
- C : 700 - 799 pts
- F : <= 699 pts

**Half-letter-grades ('+' and '-') will be given as well using cut-offs determined at the end of the semester.**

This scale is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.
