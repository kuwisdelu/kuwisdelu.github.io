## Overview

Offers students a capstone opportunity to practice data science skills learned in previous courses. Students practice visualization, data wrangling, and machine learning skills by applying them to semester-long term projects on real-world data. Students may either propose their own projects or choose from a selection of industry options. Emphasis on the overall data science process, including identification of the scientific problem, selection of appropriate machine learning methods, and visualization and communication of results. There will be occasional lectures on special topics such as visualization, communication, and data science ethics.

## Policies

Please let me know if you use a different name or pronouns from what appears the class roster. You may use a preferred name on Piazza and when submitting assignments and exams, but please be consistent and inform the instructors. The Northeastern [LGBTQA Center](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/lgbtqa/) can provide resources for [changing your name and gender marker in the Northeastern system](https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/training-and-education/gender-identity-personal-pronouns-syllabus-guidance/).

Please reach out to me early if you have difficulty keeping up with class material or completing assignments for personal reasons. The [We Care](https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/we-care/) program at Northeastern University is a resource available to you in times of stress.

All students are expected to abide by the university's [academic integrity policy](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/) and respect Northeastern's [commitment to diversity and inclusion](https://www.northeastern.edu/academic-plan/strategic-themes/diversity-and-inclusion/).

Northeastern University strictly prohibits discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, religious creed, genetic information, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran, or disability status. [Please review Northeastern's Title IX policy](https://www.northeastern.edu/ouec/), which protects individuals from sex or gender-based discrimination, including discrimination based on gender-identity. Faculty members are required to report all allegations of sex/gender-based discrimination to the Title IV coordinator.

*Please be kind and respectful to your fellow students regardless of identity or background. Students are expected to respect and use other students' names and pronouns.*

## Homework

Four small homework assignments will be assigned to practice various data science including visualization, data wrangling, and machine learning. Each homework is due online before class on the day it is listed, unless the instructions specify otherwise. Late homeworks will not be accepted. Extensions may be given individually if requested at least 48 hours in advance of the due date with a reasonable justification. Requests for re-grades must be made in writing no less than 1 week after receiving a grade. (The new grade may be lower than the original grade.)

Discussion of the homework assignments is encouraged, but all code and write-ups must be completed individually, and your submitted work should be your own. Copying other students' code or writing will not be tolerated and will be considered cheating. Solutions with a very high degree of similarity with another past or current student's will be considered plagiarism, and will be treated accordingly.

## Exams

This class has no exams.

***

## Project

Students will propose and complete two project phases in groups of 2 to 4. Projects may consist of a single semester-long project split into two phases, or two smaller half-semester projects. A selection of industry-motivated project options will also be available.

More details will be provided in class and on Piazza.

## Grading

The grade in this class is based out of 1000 points, distributed as follows:

- Projects: 2 x 400 pts
	- Proposal: 50 pts
	- Codewalk: 50 pts
	- Presentation: 100 pts
	- Report: 200 pts
- Peer review: 200 pts

Final grades will follow the following scale:

- A : 900 - 1000 pts
- B : 800 - 899 pts
- C : 700 - 799 pts
- F : <= 699 pts

**Half-letter-grades ('+' and '-') will be given as well using cut-offs determined at the end of the semester.**

This scale is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.
